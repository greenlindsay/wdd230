        <h2>Site Purpose</h2> <p>the purpose of a chamber of commerce 
            is to provide an organization that will help to 
            strengthen business relationships amongst local 
            business owners, employees and professionals of 
            all kinds of businesses. The point of my 
            Orem Chamber website will provide a source for the 
            citizens of Orem to visit and learn more about 
            the Chamber itself and its mission, which businesses 
            are a part of the organization, and events and ways to 
            get involved.
