        <p>For the design of my Chamber of Commerce website,
            I really wanted the color and font themes to be
            sophisticated and classy, since this
            is an official city organization that needs to 
            have a professional feel. I chose navy/dark blue 
            as my main color with other blue shades and 
            neutral colors for the majority of the site. I want
            my typography font to be something classy, similar to 
            Times New Roman but less generic.
