            <p>Visual hierarchy is the principle of arranging elements to show
                their order of importance. You can see in this screenshot taken from
                the Cal Ranch home page that the top of the page has larger text
                and more bold colors than the bottom of the page, which draws
                attention to the upper half before leading users' eyes downward.

            <h2>Rule of Thirds</h2>
            <h3>Gap</h3>
            <img src="images/gap.jpg" alt="Gap home page" width="50%"><br><br>
            <a href="https://www.gap.com/?ssiteID=BR">Visit Gap</a>
            <p>The rule of thirds is a technique commonly used in art and
                photography to make images look more attractive and directs
                the viewer's gaze to the main focalo point of the image.
                In this image that Gap features at the top of their home page,
                they utilize the rule of thirds using this model as to draw eyes
                to the outfit they're advertising, as well as their recent sale,
                which is placed in the first third of the image.

            <h2>Contrast</h2>
            <h3>Sunrun Inc.</h3>
            <img src="images/www.sunrun.com_(iPhone 12 Pro).png" alt="image of sunrun website illustrating Contrast"

            <p>The definition of contrast in design is "the use of different
                elements or opposites to create an arresting effect." Contrast draws
                attention to important elements or key messages in an image.
                The concept of contrast is used very well on this Sunrun Inc. page through the use of
                the dark background with the light text. This creates an attractive website
                for users to look at.
